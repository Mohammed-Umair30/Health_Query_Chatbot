# Health_Query_Chatbot
Basic Health Query Chatbot
### Objective
Create a chatbot that can answer basic health-related questions using an LLM (Large Language Model).

### Description
A general-purpose chatbot was built using either OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 API or the open-source Mistral-7B-Instruct model (Hugging Face). Prompt engineering was used to instruct the chatbot to act as a helpful virtual medical assistant. Queries were carefully filtered to avoid unsafe or diagnostic advice.

### Example Queries:
- “What causes a sore throat?”
- “Is paracetamol safe for children?”
- “What are flu symptoms?”

### 🛠Skills Demonstrated
- Prompt engineering and LLM integration  
- Chatbot development  
- API usage (OpenAI or Hugging Face)  
- Safety and ethical response handling
